## D3R Grand Challenge 4: Ligand similarity and MM-GBSA-based pose prediction and affinity ranking for BACE-1 inhibitors

This repository houses all the files for our D3R Grand Challenge 4 participation, as detailed in our manuscript entitled "D3R Grand Challenge 4: Ligand similarity and MM-GBSA-based pose prediction and affinity ranking for BACE-1 inhibitors". Here you will find all the files needed to perform docking, MD simulations and MM-GBSA end-point free energy estimates on the BACE-1 subsets provided by the D3R Grand Challenge 4 organizers for the pose prediction and the affinity ranking subchallenges.
