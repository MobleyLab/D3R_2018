folder lig_mol2_prot contains 3D structures of all the ligands in mol2 format
rec_pdb contains 3D structures of the receptors used for docking. The receptors were provided by the D3R organizers and the names are according to the ligand present in the co-crystal structures.
folder ref_lig contains structures for reference ligands. We used this information to figure out where the binding site is.
submission-z6m5b contains the files we submitted at the end of the challenge.
Files box.in, dock.in,grid.in and INSPH are input files required by DOCK 6.
Files 1_pre_lig_rec_chimera.py, 2_write_dms.sh and 3_run_dock6.sh are commands used to dock the ligands using DOCK 6. Details about how to use them are present at the beginning of each file.
